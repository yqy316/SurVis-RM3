# Large Language Model Evolution and Techniques - SurVis Visualization Interface

## Project Introduction

This SurVis visualization interface collects 10 key papers in the field of large language models, spanning from the fundamental Transformer architecture to the latest Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. This interactive visualization tool allows researchers, students, and practitioners to easily explore and analyze the relationships, timeline, and thematic distribution of these important publications.

## Literature Collection Overview

This collection contains papers from the following core areas:

- Transformer architecture foundations
- Pre-trained language models
- Prompting engineering and methods
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies
- Reasoning capabilities in large language models

These publications chronologically showcase the rapid development of the large language model field from 2017 to 2023.
